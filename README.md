## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or newer) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jakysoft/anichin-api.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:

    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

-   **For development:**
    This command uses `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on file changes.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

-   **For production:**
    This command starts the server using `node`.
    ```bash
    npm start
